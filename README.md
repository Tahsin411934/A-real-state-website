   Create a protected route where users, after logging in, can view their profile information, including their name, email, and photoURL. Users should be able to edit their name and photoURL directly within a form displayed on this route. Upon making changes, users should be able to save the updates, which will utilize Firebase's `updateProfile()` method to securely store the modified user information in Firebase.
